　　　　  <li><strong>1806:</strong> The Pyréolophore uses the first fuel injection system.</li>
      <li><strong>1874:</strong> George Brayton's constant pressure "Ready Motor" uses a metered fuel pump and burns oil fuel inside the cylinder.</li>
      <li><strong>1886:</strong> Herbert Akroyd Stuart builds a prototype hot bulb engine.</li>
      <li><strong>1887:</strong> George Brayton builds an engine that uses a spring loaded injector and solid metered injection system (lean burn combustion).</li>
      <li><strong>1890:</strong> George Brayton builds an "Air Blast" injection engine with a lean burn system.</li>
      <li><strong>1891:</strong> Herbert Akroyd Stuart patents an internal combustion engine that uses a "hot bulb" and pressurized fuel injection</li>
      <li><strong>1892:</strong> February 23, Rudolf Diesel obtained a patent (RP 67207) titled "Arbeitsverfahren und Ausführungsart für Verbrennungsmaschinen" (Working Methods and Techniques for Internal Combustion Engines).</li>
      <li><strong>1892:</strong> Akroyd Stuart builds his first working Diesel engine.</li>
      <li><strong>1893:</strong> Diesel's essay titled Theory and Construction of a Rational Motor appeared.</li>
      <li><strong>1893:</strong> August 10, Diesel built his first prototype in Augsburg, This engine never ran under its own power.</li>
      <li><strong>1894:</strong> Diesel's second prototype runs for the first time.</li>
      <li><strong>1895:</strong> Diesel applies for a second patent US Patent # 608845</li>
      <li><strong>1896:</strong> Blackstone & Co, a Stamford farm implement they built lamp start oil engines.</li>
      <li><strong>1897:</strong> Adolphus Busch licenses rights to the Diesel Engine for the US and Canada.</li>
      <li><strong>1897:</strong> After 4 years Diesel's prototype engine is running and finally ready for efficiency testing and production.</li>
      <li><strong>1898:</strong> Diesel licensed his engine to Branobel, a Russian oil company interested in an engine that could consume non-distilled oil. Branobel's engineers spent four years designing a ship-mounted engine.</li>
      <li><strong>1899:</strong> Diesel licensed his engine to builders Krupp and Sulzer, who quickly became major manufacturers.</li>
