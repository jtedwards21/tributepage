　　  <span id="introduction col-md-12">The diesel engine is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel that has been injected into the combustion chamber is caused by the high temperature which a gas achieves when greatly compressed.</span>
    <ul id="timeline col-md-12">
　　　　  <li>1806 The Pyréolophore uses the first fuel injection system.</li>
      <li>1874 George Brayton's constant pressure "Ready Motor" uses a metered fuel pump and burns oil fuel inside the cylinder.</li>
      <li>1886: Herbert Akroyd Stuart builds a prototype hot bulb engine.</li>
      <li>1887 George Brayton builds an engine that uses a spring loaded injector and solid metered injection system (lean burn combustion).</li>
      <li>1890 George Brayton builds an "Air Blast" injection engine with a lean burn system.</li>
      <li>1891: Herbert Akroyd Stuart patents an internal combustion engine that uses a "hot bulb" and pressurized fuel injection</li>
      <li>1892: February 23, Rudolf Diesel obtained a patent (RP 67207) titled "Arbeitsverfahren und Ausführungsart für Verbrennungsmaschinen" (Working Methods and Techniques for Internal Combustion Engines).</li>
      <li>1892: Akroyd Stuart builds his first working Diesel engine.</li>
      <li>1893: Diesel's essay titled Theory and Construction of a Rational Motor appeared.</li>
      <li>1893: August 10, Diesel built his first prototype in Augsburg, This engine never ran under its own power.</li>
      <li>1894 Diesel's second prototype runs for the first time.</li>
      <li>1895 Diesel applies for a second patent US Patent # 608845</li>
      <li>1896 Blackstone & Co, a Stamford farm implement they built lamp start oil engines.</li>
      <li>1897: Adolphus Busch licenses rights to the Diesel Engine for the US and Canada.</li>
      <li>1897 After 4 years Diesel's prototype engine is running and finally ready for efficiency testing and production.</li>
      <li>1898: Diesel licensed his engine to Branobel, a Russian oil company interested in an engine that could consume non-distilled oil. Branobel's engineers spent four years designing a ship-mounted engine.</li>
      <li>1899: Diesel licensed his engine to builders Krupp and Sulzer, who quickly became major manufacturers.</li>
